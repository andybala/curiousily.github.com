    "Remember the first time you went behind the wheel of a car? Your dad, mom or driving instructor was next to you, waiting for you to mess something up. You had a clear goal - make a couple of turns and get to the supermarket for ice cream. The task was infinitely more fun if you had to learn to drive stick. Ah, good times. Too bad that your kids might never experience that. More on that later.\n",

    "# What is Reinforcement Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning (RL) is learning what to do, given a situation and a set of possible actions to choose from, in order to maximize a reward. The learner, which we will call agent, is not told what to do, he must discover this by himself through interacting with the environment. The goal is to choose its actions in such a way that the cumulative reward is maximized. So, choosing the best reward now, might not be the best decision, in the long run. That is greedy approaches might not be optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to you, behind the wheel with running engine, properly strapped seatbelt, adrenaline pumping and rerunning the latest Fast & Furious through your mind - you have a good feeling about this, the passenger next to you does not look that scared, after all...\n",
    "\n",
    "How all of this relates to RL? Let's try to map your situation to an RL problem. Driving is really complex, so for your first lesson, your instructor will do everything, except turning the wheel. The environment is the nature itself and the agent is you. The state of the environment (situation) can be defined by the position of your car, surrounding cars, pedestrians, upcoming crossroads etc. You have 3 possible actions to choose from - turn left, keep straight and turn right. The reward is well defined - you will eat ice cream if you are able to reach the supermarket. Your instructor will give your intermediate rewards based on your performance. At each step (let's say once every second), you will have to make a decision - turn left, right or continue straight ahead. Whether or not the ice cream is happening is mostly up to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's summarize what we've learned so far. We have an agent and an environment. The environment gives the agent a state. The agent chooses an action and receives a reward from the environment along with the new state. This learning process continues until the goal is achieved or some other condition is met.\n",

    "# Formalizing the RL problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Markov Decision Process (MDP) is mathematical formulations of the RL problem. They satisfy the Markov property:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Markov property** - the current state completely represents the state of the environment (world). That is, the future depends only on the present.\n",
    "\n",
    "An MDP can be defined by $(S, A, R, P, \\gamma)$ where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $S$ - set of possible states\n",
    "- $A$ - set of possible actions\n",
    "- $R$ - probability distribution of reward given (state, action) pair\n",
    "- $P$ - probability distribution over how likely any of the states is to be the new states, given (state, action) pair. Also known as transition probability.\n",
    "- $\\gamma$ - reward discount factor\n",
    "\n",
    "## How MDPs work\n",
    "\n",
    "At the initial time step $t=0$, the environment chooses initial state $s_0 \\sim p(s_0)$. That state is used as a seed state for the following loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "for $t=0$ until done:\n",
    " - The agent selects action $a_t$\n",
    " - The environment chooses reward $r_t \\sim R(. |\\, s_t, a_t)$ and next state $s_{t + 1} \\sim P(. |\\, s_t, a_t)$\n",
    " - The agent receives reward $r_t$ and next state $s_{t + 1}$\n",
    " \n",
    "More formally, the environment does not choose, it samples from the reward and transition probability distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the objective of all this? Find a function $\\pi^*$, known as optimal policy, that maximizes the cumulative discounted reward: $\\sum_{t > 0}\\gamma^t r_t$.\n",

    "A policy $\\pi$ is a function that maps state $s$ to action $a$, that our agent believes is the best given that state."
