    "The correlation gives us a way to measure how strong the relationship is between two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider two random variables $X$ and $Y$. The *covariance* between $X$ and $Y$ is written as $Cov(X, Y)$. The covariance gives us information about how $X$ and $Y$ are statistically related. Here is a definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Cov}(X,Y)=\\mathbb{E}\\big[(X-\\mathbb{E}[X])(Y-\\mathbb{E}[Y])\\big]=\\mathbb{E}[XY]-\\mathbb{E}[X]\\mathbb{E}[Y].$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $a = \\mathbb{E}[X]$ and $b = \\mathbb{E}[Y]$, then we have\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{E}\\big[(X - a)(Y - b)\\big] = \\\\\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}(XY - bX - aY + ab) = \\\\\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}(XY) - b\\mathbb{E}(X) - a\\mathbb{E}(Y) + ab = \\\\\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}(XY) - \\mathbb{E}(X)\\mathbb{E}(Y) - \\mathbb{E}(Y)\\mathbb{E}(X) + \\mathbb{E}(X)\\mathbb{E}(Y) = \\\\\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}(XY) - \\mathbb{E}(X)\\mathbb{E}(Y).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When $Cov(X, Y) = 0$, we say that $X$ and $Y$ are *uncorrelated*. A positive or negative covariance indicates the direction and strength of the correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some properties of covariance:\n",
    "\n",
    "For any random variables $X, Y and Z$ and any scalar values $a and b$:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $Cov(X, X) = var(X)$ \n",
    "2. if $X$ and $Y$ are independent then $Cov(X, Y) = 0$\n",
    "3. $Cov(X, Y) = Cov(Y, X)$\n",
    "4. $Cov(aX,Y)=aCov(X,Y)$\n",
    "5. $Cov(X + c, Y) = Cov(X, Y)$\n",
    "6. $Cov(X + Y, Z) = Cov(X, Z) + Cov(Y, Z)$\n",
    "7. $cov(X, aY + b) = aCov(X, Y)$\n",
    "8. More generally,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Cov\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{m}a_iX_i, \\sum_{j=1}^{n}b_jY_j\\right)=\\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_ib_j Cov(X_i,Y_j).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if $X$ and $Y$ are independent, we have $\\mathbb{E}[XY] = \\mathbb{E}[X]\\mathbb{E}[Y]$, which implies that $Cov(X, Y) = 0.$ Thus, if $X$ and $Y$ are independent, they are uncorrelated. Generally, the converse is not true.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Correlation coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "The **correlation coefficient** $\\rho(X, Y)$ of two random variables $X$ and $Y$ that have nonzero variances is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\rho(X, Y) = \\frac{Cov(X, Y)}{\\sqrt{Var(X)Var(Y)}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be viewed as normalized version of the covariance $Cov(X, Y)$ and it can be shown that $\\rho$ ranges from -1 to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\rho > 0$ or $\\rho < 0$, the the values of $Cov(X, Y)$ \"tend\" to have the same sign. The size of $|\\rho|$ provides a normalized measure of the extent to which this is true. If $\\rho = 1$ or $\\rho = -1$ and assuming that $X$ and $Y$ have positive variances, there exists a positive (or negative, respectively) constant $c$ such that:\n",
